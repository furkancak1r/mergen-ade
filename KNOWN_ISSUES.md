### Known Issues & Fix Log

#### Release binary wrong output location (root vs target/release) {#release-binary-wrong-output-location-root-vs-target-release}
- Date: 2026-03-04T14:20:34Z
- Context: main/Windows local PowerShell/cargo 1.93.1
- Error signature: Expected updated binary under `target/release/mergen-ade.exe`, but an extra root-level `mergen-ade.exe` was produced.
- Symptoms/Impact: Contributors can run a stale or unintended executable from repo root and think the latest fix is missing.
- Root cause: Release artifact handling copied the binary to repository root instead of treating `target/release` as the single source of truth.
- Resolution: Build flow was corrected to update `target/release/mergen-ade.exe` only and remove the root copy (`mergen-ade.exe`) in local workspace (commit pending).
- Prevent recurrence:
  - Always verify artifact path with `Get-Item target\\release\\mergen-ade.exe` after `cargo build --release`.
  - Do not copy release artifacts to repository root.
  - Add/keep CI checks and release notes explicitly referencing `target/release` output path.
- Files/Commands touched: `target/release/mergen-ade.exe`, `mergen-ade.exe` (removed), `cargo build --release`, `cmd /c del /f /q mergen-ade.exe`
- References: commit pending in local workspace; recent baseline commits `3eee74b`, `559605d`
